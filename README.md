## Statement of Problem
 Current system of Smart CHD Card System is manual file base system therefore its proper 
way to store pregnant mothers and new born children data such as registration of the child, 
their treatment details, development of the child etc. It is difficult to find those data in an 
emergency situation. Parents may not always easy to access children’s health records and they 
can miss appointments of vaccination. 
 Every now and then, health officials have to calculate children’s BMI values, which take 
some times. Also, children’s height, weight and BMI charts have to be drawn by hand, and 
therefore, a lack of efficiency can be seen in the traditional method. Another problem with the 
current system is data analysis, which takes a lot of time

card system that monitor the health of pregnant mother and small children and also helps give
